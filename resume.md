## __Working Experience__

### __Embedded Software Engineer at Telescope Services__ _Nov 2022 - Present_

- **Project:** Battery Management System (BMS)    
- **Role:** Embedded Software Engineer

Integration of a newer version of an RTOS to a new microcontroller in an Evaluation Board as a proof of concept. Performed reverse enginering analysis on a legacy project to understand the configuration of the previous RTOS version (PXROS) in order to have a smooth migration with the appropriate architecture.

### __Advanced Embedded Software Engineer at Honeywell International__ _Nov 2021 - Nov 2022_

- **Project:** Network Card Gateway    
- **Role:** Embedded Software Engineer

Use of Embedded Linux and C++ for fire products. The network card acted as a gateway to connect fire devices such as fire panels, audio devices, among others. Proposed and coordinated the implementation of an agile process for code reviews to ensure code quality using Atlassian Frameworks such as Bitbucket, Jira and Confluence. Responsible for DevSecOps in this project.
<br>

### __Senior/Lead Software Engineer at Harman International__ _Apr 2016 - Nov 2021_

- **Project:** Audio Amplifier    
- **Role:** Software Technical Lead / Embedded Software Engineer

Coached and mentored new team members in the Software Development Process followed internally which was ASPICE compliant. Collaborated in peer-reviews to have clean and easy-to-read code. Received constant feedback from team members to get new ideas for improving the code performance or avoiding the introduction of software bugs.

Improved features from legacy code following internal code standards and the company's ASPICE process. Debugged and improved I2C drivers, and fixed several issues in maintenance projects. Responsible for aligment with Hardware, Validation and Project Management Teams to ensure Software releases are done on time.

Travelled to United States and Japan to meet with the customer to solve critical issues that needed to be addressed. A report that explained the root-cause of the issues and the proposed fixes was shared with the customer. Close collaboration with colleagues from United States, India and Japan.

- **Project:** Audio Amplifier    
- **Role:** Embedded Software Engineer

Responsible for implementing new features for an audio amplifier such as sending new equalization to the DSP for an audio wave played during ignition time. Performed code optimization and robustness improvement for certain audio devices. Close collaboration with colleagues from United States and India.

### __Software Engineer at Delphi (now Aptiv)__ _Jan 2015 - Apr 2016_

- **Project:** Infotainment System    
- **Role:** Embedded Software Engineer

Responsible for middleware development and issue fixing for the FM and RDS modules of the "Tuner" component which is reponsible for radio signal management. Perfomed Unit Tests with Google-Test and Software/Systems requirements analysis.

### __Electronics Engineer Intern at Physics Institute of Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)__ _Jan 2013 - Jan 2015_

- **Project:** Computer Interface for X-ray tube manipulation    
- **Role:** Intern

The interface was developed in LabView and communicated with the power supply of the X-ray tube through serial communication. This interface communicated with other instruments such as a barometer, termometer and a radiation meter. The X-ray tube was manipulated through voltage variations. A test bench was created to control a group of servomotors using a PIC microcontroller and an LCD screen. The servomotors controlled a structure that controlled the position of a radiation meter in the X and Y axis.
